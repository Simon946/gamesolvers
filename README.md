# Game Solvers
Code for when you do a puzzle or game and want the solution.

I wrote this code over the years when I was too frustrated and impatient to solve the puzzles manually. Be aware that there are bugs and if you find one, let me know. Also if you want to improve the code, please do so and if you have questions I'm happy to help :)

Some solvers are more like a programming exercise than an actually useful tool so note that some solvers might not be able to solve all puzzles. 

All code works on linux with GCC, some solvers require SFML.

Please don't steal my code. You can use it however you want but don't pretend that you wrote my code.
